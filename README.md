* Have you ever wondered how "race" and ancestry are "calculated" by 23andMe or Ancestry.com? Have you ever questioned why your results seemed so "wrong"? Well, in this workshop we'll be building our own admixture (ancestry) reports from publicly available data as well as showing how we can "hack race" to make racial results different.
* The respository is based on modified code from https://github.com/hagax8/ancestry_viz 

## Step 0: Download the Data
`chmod +x download_viz.sh`
`./download_viz.sh`

## Step 1: Run ancestry clustering
